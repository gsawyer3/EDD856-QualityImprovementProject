## The Presenting Problem

The employees are not using SharePoint

## Five Whys
1.  Why are people not using SharePoint?  
They like to use the old system  
2.  Why do they like to use the old system?  
They don’t want to use SharePoint?  
3.  Why don’t they want to use SP?  
They don’t think it is any better than old (maybe worse).  
4.  Why don’t they think it’s better?  
They haven’t been shown/taught  
5.  [Why haven’t they been taught?  
Leadership didn’t think it was necessary…]
